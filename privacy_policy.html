  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Gustave Eiffel Meknès</strong> mobile application is committed to protecting your privacy. This app is designed purely for informational purposes and does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not require any user registration, and the app does not request access to your location, contacts, camera, storage, or any other personal data or device permissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application only displays static information such as school details, gallery images, contact phone number, and email. There are no background services, no analytics tracking, and no third-party integrations.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you choose to contact the school via the displayed phone number or email, that communication takes place outside of the app and is handled directly by the user.
  </p>

  <p>
    Should we ever update the app to include new features that require data processing, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and you will be informed transparently.
  </p>
