    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      At <strong>Gustave Eiffel MeknÃ¨s Educational Complex</strong>, your privacy and security are a top priority. This mobile application is built with simplicity and transparency in mind, specifically for displaying school information only.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      This app does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal data. It does not request access to your camera, microphone, contacts, location, or any other sensitive features.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>
      The application functions <strong>without requesting any device permissions</strong>. It works offline and does not interact with any other services or apps on your phone.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What the App Does</h2>
    <p>
      The app provides basic information about our school, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our school levels (Preschool, Primary, Middle School, High School)</li>
      <li>School contact number and email</li>
      <li>A short description of our institution</li>
      <li>A gallery with school-related images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It only displays this information in a clean, simple format â€” <strong>no interaction or submission from users is required or possible</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. WhatsApp & Contact</h2>
    <p>
      While a school phone number is displayed in the app, there is <strong>no redirection or integration with WhatsApp or any third-party services</strong>. You are free to contact us by phone or email, outside of the app, at your discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Trust Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect or track anything, your privacy is fully preserved. No cookies, no background services, and no analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Updates</h2>
    <p>
      If future versions of the app include features that may require data or permissions, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect those changes. You will always have the right to review the latest version here.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
